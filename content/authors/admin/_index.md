Feel free to take a look around. If you're visiting as a potential employer, be sure to check out the CV snapshot for a quick summary of my professional identity. If visiting as a student, a link to course materials is just a bit further down. And finally, if visiting for no reason at all, I recommend you visit the following [link](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=How+to+find+a+hobby).

A couple of the statistical topics Javier has developed a particular interest in are model selection (especially in high-dimensional settings) and post-selection inference. Through his professional collaborations with individuals outside the Department of Biostatistics, he has also developed an appreciation for injury epidemiological and health disparities research.

Research activity aside, Javier is actively involved within his student and professional community, having held presidential positions (among other roles of high responsibility) within departmental and collegiate organizations. Javier has a deep passion for teaching and mentoring, and is fortunate enough to consistently do both through the Iowa Summer Institute in Biostatistics (ISIB) - a summer program designed to provide biostatistical research education and training to undergraduate students, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds.
