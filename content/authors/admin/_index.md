Originally from the subtropical paradise that is Brownsville, Texas, Javier experienced a temporary lapse of sanity in 2015 when he decided to leave Brownsville to pursue a PhD in Biostatistics at the not-so-subtropically located University of Iowa.  He has since remained at Iowa (despite presumably regaining his sanity) because, as it would so happen, Javier has had a really great time learning about statistics and working with some incredible people...not to mention that he still has a dissertation to write :sweat_smile:!

<!--
A couple of the statistical topics Javier has developed a particular interest in are model selection (especially in high-dimensional settings) and post-selection inference. Through his professional collaborations with individuals outside the Department of Biostatistics, he has also developed an appreciation for injury epidemiological and health disparities research.

Research activity aside, Javier is actively involved within his student and professional community, having held presidential positions (among other roles of high responsibility) within departmental and collegiate organizations. Javier has a deep passion for teaching and mentoring, and is fortunate enough to consistently do both through the Iowa Summer Institute in Biostatistics (ISIB) - a summer program designed to provide biostatistical research education and training to undergraduate students, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds.
