**Javier E. Flores** is a PhD candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Iowa. His dissertation work involves the development of a new class of discrepancy-based information criteria for the selection of predictive models. Existing criteria most widely used for this purpose are the Aikaike Information Criterion (AIC) and its variants. However, these criteria presume a panel of validation data generated independently but identically to the training data used to fit candidate models. Javier's work offers criteria free of this assumption, allowing for improvements in prediction. Additionally, practical implementation of these criteria allow for "personalized prediction" via the selection of models specific to individual validation observations.
