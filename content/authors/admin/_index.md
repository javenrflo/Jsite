I am a PhD candidate and graduate research assistant in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Iowa. Through my role as a graduate research assistant, I have acted as the collaborating statistician and worked with professionally diverse teams to explore questions within the realm of injury epidemiology. I am currently working with a team of legal experts, an epidemiologist, and a psychologist to investigate the longitudinal effects of state-level anti-bullying legislation on bullying and other youth violence outcomes.

My dissertation work involves the development of model selection criteria which may be used to identify the best predictive model among a candidate set. Recognizing the rising popularity of personalized/precision medicine, our criteria allow for the selection of a locally optimal predictive model specific to and informed by the attributes characterizing an individual of interest.

Outside of my collaborative and methodological work I have served key roles in various departmental and collegiate organizations and committees. I am also regularly involved with our department's Summer Institute in Biostatistics, which is a seven week program that provides training in biostatistics to undergraduate students - primarily those from underrepresented backgrounds.

When I'm not doing any of these other things, I spend time reading manga, playing with my dogs, and making (often bad) attempts at new dinner recipes. I also enjoy listening to music, with reggae and heavy metal being my favorite genres.

A couple of the statistical topics Javier has developed a particular interest in are model selection (especially in high-dimensional settings) and post-selection inference. Through his professional collaborations with individuals outside the Department of Biostatistics, he has also developed an appreciation for injury epidemiological and health disparities research.

Research activity aside, Javier is actively involved within his student and professional community, having held presidential positions (among other roles of high responsibility) within departmental and collegiate organizations. Javier has a deep passion for teaching and mentoring, and is fortunate enough to consistently do both through the Iowa Summer Institute in Biostatistics (ISIB) - a summer program designed to provide biostatistical research education and training to undergraduate students, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds.
